# EPA-simmodel
This is the repository of group 25 for EPA1361: Model-based Decision-making.

The group has added 4 notebooks with their analyses:

* Open Exploration is performed in Open_Exploration.ipynb
* Global Sensitivy Analysis in Extra_Trees.ipynb
* Many Objective Robust Decision Making in MORDM.ipynb
* Multi-Scenario MORDM in Multi-Scenario_MORDM.ipynb

Extra_Trees.ipynb uses results from Open_Exploration.ipynb.
Multi-Scenario_MORDM.ipynb uses results from MORDM.ipynb.

These results are all saved to the results folder. All the relevent figures for the report have been saved to the Figures folder.

We have defined two model specifications in problem_formulation.py of our own from line 268 to 354.
